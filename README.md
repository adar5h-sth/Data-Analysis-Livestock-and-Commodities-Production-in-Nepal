# Agricultural and Livestock Data Analysis in Nepal

A data science project exploring agricultural and livestock trends across Nepalese districts using real-world datasets. The project involves data cleaning, interactive visualizations, and predictive modeling using linear regression.

## Overview

- **Objective**: Analyze agricultural and livestock datasets from Nepal to uncover patterns and predict production metrics.
- **Tools**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Scikit-learn
- **ML Model**: Linear Regression for predictive analytics
- **Focus Areas**: EDA, data visualization, machine learning, performance evaluation

## Datasets

The project uses multiple datasets including:

- Horse population by district  
- Milk animals and milk production  
- Meat production  
- Wool and egg production  
- Rabbit and Yak population

## Libraries Used

- `pandas` - Data manipulation
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` - Static data visualization
- `plotly` - Interactive visualizations
- `scikit-learn` - Linear regression, model evaluation
- `numpy` - Numerical operations

## Model Summary

Built a **Linear Regression** model to predict agricultural outputs using livestock features. Evaluated using:

- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **R² Score**

## Key Insights

- Identified regional disparities in production metrics.
- Found strong correlation between livestock population and outputs like milk and meat.
- Detected outliers and potential areas for agricultural optimization.
